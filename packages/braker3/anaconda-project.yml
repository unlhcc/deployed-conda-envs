description: BRAKER3 enables the usage of RNA-seq and protein data in a fully automated
  pipeline to train and predict highly reliable genes with GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS.
  The result of the pipeline is the combined gene set of both gene prediction tools,
  which only contains genes with very high support from extrinsic evidence.
