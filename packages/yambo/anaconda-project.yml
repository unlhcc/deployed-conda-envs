description: YAMBO implements Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) methods (such as
  GW and BSE) and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), which allows for
  accurate prediction of fundamental properties as band gaps of semiconductors, band
  alignments, defect quasi-particle energies, optics and out-of-equilibrium properties
  of materials. The code resorts to previously computed electronic structure, usually
  at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level and for this reason it is interfaced
  with two of the most used planewave DFT codes used in scientific community, Quantum
  ESPRESSO and Abinit.
