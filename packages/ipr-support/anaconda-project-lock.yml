# This is an Anaconda project lock file.
# The lock file locks down exact versions of all your dependencies.
#
# In most cases, this file is automatically maintained by the `anaconda-project` command or GUI tools.
# It's best to keep this file in revision control (such as git or svn).
# The file is in YAML format, please see http://www.yaml.org/start.html for more.
#

#
# Set to false to ignore locked versions.
