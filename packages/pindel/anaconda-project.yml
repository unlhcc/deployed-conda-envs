description: Pindel can detect breakpoints of large deletions, medium sized insertions,
  inversions, tandem duplications and other structural variants at single-based resolution
  from next-gen sequence data. It uses a pattern growth approach to identify the breakpoints
  of these variants from paired-end short reads.
