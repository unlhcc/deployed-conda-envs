description: kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from
  bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput
  sequencing reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly determining
  the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for alignment.
